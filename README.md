# Manorrock Assistant

Note this project was developed using AI as proof of concept to determine how far AI assistated development has come. So be aware that most of the code was generated by AI.

If you want to try it out, you can do so, but you will have to build it yourself.

Contributions are welcome, but be aware this is neither funded nor supported by any organization.
